    <div id="root"> NOT Render

        <!-- <h1>NAMASTE REACT</h1>  -> USING HTML -->

        <!-- <h2>This is a h2 tag which will not render in our browser 
            because it is written inside the root div which is now the root element
            of our react
        </h2> -->

    </div>

    <!-- <script>

        let heading = document.createElement('h1');
        heading.innerHTML = "NAMASTE REACT";

        let root = document.getElementById("root");

        root.appendChild(heading);

    </script> -> This is using the Java Script-->




    <!--Now injecting react library inside our html file-->

    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

<!--The above two lines are the CDN links of React and the minimum code of the react 
    that means we have inserted the react in our code.
    React is nothing but js code written by facebook tems for us.
    
    Question-> Why there is two CDN files for injecting the React?
    
    Answer -> See React is not just for browser only there is React native also
              so First file which is react@18 is core library of React, 
              and Second file which is react-dom@18 is the browser library of React
              which give us access of ReactDOM and @18 means version 18 which is a latest version.-->




<!--Now creating Heading using React-->

<!-- <script>

    const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "NAMASTE REACT");

    //{} -> inside this empty brases we can give id,class etc.. to our element which we have created.
    //      also check in the console that how DOM render it.

    //To run the react code we have to define/create a root element 

    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

    //so the above code means that -- 
    //ReactDOM.createRoot() -- defines the root element where our react will be run for the browsers.


    root.render(heading); //render the heading inside the root element.
    

</script> -->

<script>

 const heading = React.createElement("h1", {id:"headingElement"}, "Namaste React");
 
 console.log(heading) // output will be a object of type h1.
 
 const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));


 //passing a react element in a root
 root.render(heading);


 //React elements are just Objects of JS and nothing else.

</script>
