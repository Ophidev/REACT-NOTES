# what do I understand by HOOK,useState and useEffect

* Hook is a special javaScript functions which are introduced in react to perform some special tasks.

* useState() is a Hook which is used to create State Variables. an State Variable is different from normal JS varialbes because react track them and renders in UI direcltly.

* useEffect() is a Hook which is used to in React to run specific code which is dependent on something like(state variable,props etc...) for this perpose useEffect contain a dependent array and if we set an empty array useEffect inside code will execute only once after full page loads.

* `useEffect()` is a Hook used to run the piece of code which is dependent on someother value render for this we pass an dependent array in our useEffect() and give the value on which our piece of code is dependent 

  * and if we want the use Effect to run at once after all component renders(full page renders) then we pass empty dependent array

  * and if we want to renders the useEffect inside code at every renders of a component we 
  does not pass any dependent array.




# React Hooks: `useState` and `useEffect`

## **Hooks in React**
- Hooks are **special functions** introduced in React (since version 16.8) to enable functional components to use:
  - **State** (`useState`)
  - **Lifecycle methods** (`useEffect`)
  - And other React features.



---

## **useState()**
- **What it does**:  
  `useState` is a **Hook** used to create and manage **state variables** in functional components.

- **Why it's special**:  
  State variables created with `useState` are **reactive**, meaning:
  - React **tracks changes** to these variables.
  - React automatically **re-renders** the component when ever any state or props value changes but did not renders the whole page.( update UI automatically)

- The useState hook in React does return an array. This array contains two elements:
  - **The current state value.**
  - **A function to update the state.**

- **How it works**:  
  ```javascript
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);


# **React Hook: `useEffect`**

## **What it Does**
`useEffect` is a Hook for handling **side effects** in a React component. Examples of side effects include:
- Fetching data from an API.
- Subscribing to events.
- Manually manipulating the DOM.
- In React, dependencies in the useEffect dependency array can only be state variables, props, or any value derived from them. 

---

## **Dependency Array**
The behavior of `useEffect` depends on the **dependency array**:

1. **No Array Provided**:  
   The effect runs **after every render**.

2. **Empty Array (`[]`)**:  
   The effect runs **once** after the component mounts.

3. **Array with Dependencies (`[dep1, dep2]`)**:  
   The effect runs **only when the specified dependencies change**.

---

## **How it Works**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Your side-effect logic here
}, [dependencies]);



## What  is Microservices

# Microservices: An Overview

## What Are Microservices?
Microservices is a software development architecture where a large application is divided into smaller, independent services, each focusing on a specific functionality. These services work together to form a complete application.

## Key Characteristics
- **Independence**: Each service is self-contained and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Decentralized**: Each service has its database and manages its data.
- **Technology Diversity**: Developers can use different programming languages and tools for each service.
- **Communication**: Services communicate with each other using lightweight protocols, often via REST APIs, gRPC, or messaging queues.
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled based on their needs without affecting the whole application.

## Advantages
- Flexibility in technology choice.
- Easier to scale and deploy specific services.
- Better fault isolation: Issues in one service don’t crash the whole application.
- Improved development speed by enabling parallel work.

## Challenges
- Complex to manage and monitor multiple services.
- Requires robust inter-service communication.
- Demands efficient deployment strategies like containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes).

## Example
Imagine an e-commerce platform:
- **User Service**: Manages user accounts and profiles.
- **Product Service**: Handles product listings and inventory.
- **Order Service**: Manages order placement and tracking.
- **Payment Service**: Processes payments securely.

These services are developed and maintained independently but collaborate to deliver the complete e-commerce experience.



# Monolith Architecture: An Overview

## What Is Monolith Architecture?
Monolith architecture is a software design pattern where an entire application is built as a single, unified codebase. All the functionalities, such as user interface, business logic, and database access, are bundled together in one application.


## Key Characteristics
- **Single Codebase**: All components (UI, logic, database) are part of the same codebase.
- **Unified Deployment**: The entire application is deployed as a single unit.
- **Shared Resources**: Components share the same database and server resources.
- **Tightly Coupled**: Changes in one part can affect the entire application.


## Advantages
- **Simplicity**: Easy to develop, test, and deploy for small to medium-sized projects.
- **Performance**: Faster internal communication since everything runs within one process.
- **Easier Debugging**: Developers can debug the entire system in one place.
- **Lower Overhead**: No need for complex communication between components.


## Disadvantages
- **Scalability Issues**: Difficult to scale specific parts of the application independently.
- **Maintenance Challenges**: Harder to maintain as the application grows in size and complexity.
- **Risk of Downtime**: A failure in one part can affect the entire application.
- **Technology Lock-in**: Limited flexibility in using different technologies for different functionalities.


## Example
Imagine a simple blogging platform:
- **Single Application**: Handles user authentication, blog creation, comment management, and serving content.
- **Shared Database**: All functionalities use one common database.
- **Deployment**: The entire application is packaged and deployed as one unit.

Monolith architecture is a good choice for small teams or projects that don’t require high scalability or flexibility.



# What is Shimmer UI?

## Overview
Shimmer UI is a design pattern that mimics the structure of a page's actual UI while content is still loading. It provides users with a visual preview of what to expect, making the waiting experience more intuitive and engaging. Instead of displaying a basic loading spinner or progress bar, a Shimmer UI uses animated placeholders to indicate where content will appear.

## Key Features
- **Realistic Preview**: The shimmer layout resembles the actual UI, helping users understand the structure and content areas of the page.
- **Improved User Experience**: By giving users a sense of progress, it reduces perceived wait times and enhances engagement.
- **Better Alternative to Spinners**: Compared to a generic loading circle, a shimmer effect provides more context and makes the loading process feel smoother.

## Benefits
1. **Enhanced Feedback**: Users can anticipate the content layout while waiting for data to load.
2. **Professional Appearance**: Adds a polished touch to your application compared to simple spinners or loaders.
3. **User Engagement**: Keeps users engaged and reduces frustration during long load times (3-5 seconds or more).

## When to Use
- **Data-Heavy Applications**: When pages require time to fetch and render large amounts of data (e.g., social feeds, product listings).
- **Progressive Loading**: When content loads in chunks, and it's essential to give a sense of progress.

## How It Works
1. Placeholder components (shapes like rectangles, circles, etc.) mimic the structure of the actual UI.
2. A shimmering animation runs over the placeholders, indicating loading in progress.
3. Once the content is ready, the placeholders are replaced with the actual data.

## Example Use Cases
- A social media app displaying shimmer placeholders for profile pictures, posts, and comments.
- An e-commerce app showing placeholders for product images, titles, and prices while loading.

Shimmer UI is a simple yet powerful technique to improve user experience during loading times.
